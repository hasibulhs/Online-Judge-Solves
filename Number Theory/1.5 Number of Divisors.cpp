We can do this using naive approach but, we can do this using prime factorization too.

Suppose, doing prime factorization, we get = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * p3^e3 * ..... * pn^en.
So, the total number of divisors will be = (e1 + 1) * (e2 + 1) * (e3 + 1) * .... * (en + 1).


Q. n = 10^12. Find the values whos total divisors are exactly 3.
S. p^2 who are less than n (where p is prime).

Q. n = 10^12. Find the values whos total divisors are exactly 4.
S. p^3 or p * q who are less than n (p and q both are prime).
